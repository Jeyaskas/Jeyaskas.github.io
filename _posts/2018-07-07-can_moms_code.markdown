                                 Can Moms code?,Do moms code?,yes and they definitely should.women in tech is not growing  but has dropped since 1984 says forums and i have come across too many times in person.
                                                              My first brush with coding was learning software Testing,programming and trying to teach the same in my part time job as a STEM teacher.I started teaching through SCRATCH programming,i thought,it was a great idea to teach young children to code.My interest kept me hooked on ;to teach young children.
																															I taught EV3 Robotics ,on how to build a Robot,then finally programming it to run on a platform with  specific set of instructions or tasks,it was never easy teaching an elementary schooler or middle schooler and maintain their level of interest from the initial stage of programming to up until the final stages of execution.But as i got deeper into teaching Robotics,Programming and Coding,boys took the lead and it was ok for girls to switch to 3D and designing.I always wondered why and when i took a good look around me,it was obvious that i was the only women instructor in Robotics and other male counter parts were engineers,programmers,graduates,gamers and interns and not a single women in sight.why not women?yes i mean literally,i am single mom trying to teach programming and coding,and not many women choose coding as their choice.The more i did my research on coding,it was obvious i wanted to choose coding as my personal interest.I ended up visting  Flatiron school open house.I learned that day ,errors are how you learn/ teach yourself to code,that struck a chord,that is how i figure out my life too ;through errors.Coding has a creative edge and gives me immense satisfaction,so here goes a code noobie,as i would like call myself,a single mom.I want to teach my children and to get them intersted in tech early on and maybe contribute ,My journey begins...
